Create a biometric pattern for each image by analyzing key facial features, including: - The distance between the eyes. - The shape and size of the nose. - The structure of the jawline and cheekbones. - The contour of the lips and eyebrows. 2. Compare the biometric patterns of the two images to determine if they match. 3. Provide a confidence percentage (0-100) indicating how closely the images match. 4. Return the result in the following JSON format: {\"IsMatch\": true/false, \"Confidence\": 0-100, \"Message\": \"Explanation of the result\"}. The 'Message' field must be brief and no longer than 35 words. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside the JSON structure."
